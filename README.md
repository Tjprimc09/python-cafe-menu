Café Menu Ordering System (Python)

This is a Python program I developed in Comp-Sci 101 that handles a complete café ordering process. Users can browse the menu, build and edit an order, apply discounts, calculate tax, and generate a formatted receipt. The program also tracks multiple customers and produces daily sales stats. It shows my ability to design a clean multi-step workflow, validate user input, and manage order and pricing data using lists, tuples, and dictionaries.
